## Background

- Since you're already using `windows-10` there is already a `.NET Framework` and `Powershell` on your computer.
- But we are going to focus on `.Net Core` ( nickname `dotNetCore` or `dotVM` ) which is a recent `open source` and `cross-platform` version of `.Net Framework` ( which is closed source and works only on windows)
